%organum-pedal;

# Example pedal map for Organum
# =============================
#
# All pedal maps must begin with the %organum-pedal; signature shown
# above.  The file follows the Shastina format.
#
# The interpreter stack supports three kinds of data:
#
#   (1) Integer -- stored by value as signed, 32-bit integer
#   (2) Float -- stored by value as a finite double-precision number
#   (3) String -- stored by reference with reference counting
#
# Strings are immutable after construction.  Strings only allow visible,
# printing US-ASCII characters, along with space.  Empty strings are
# allowed.
#
# Between the opening signature and the |; that ends the pedal map, only
# the following Shastina entity types are allowed:
#
#   1. STRING
#   2. NUMERIC
#   3. BEGIN GROUP
#   4. END GROUP
#   5. ARRAY
#   6. OPERATION
#
# String entities must be enclosed within double quotes, with no prefix
# before the opening quote.  Apart from visible, printing US-ASCII
# characters, only space is allowed.  No line break may be present.  The
# following two escapes are supported:
#
#   \\   -- literal backslash
#   \"   -- literal double quote
#
# Unrecognized backslash escapes cause an error.
#
# String entities cause a new string to be constructed and a reference
# to this string to be pushed onto the stack.
#
# Numeric entities have the following format:
#
#   1. Optionally, a "+" or "-" sign
#   2. Sequence of zero or more decimal digits
#   3. Optionally:
#      a) "." sign, followed by
#      b) Sequence of zero or more decimal digits
#   4. Optionally:
#      a) "e" or "E", follwed by
#      b) Optional "+" or "-" sign, followed by
#      c) Sequence of one or more decimal digits
#
# At least one decimal digit must be present in (2) or (3).  If neither
# "." nor "e" nor "E" is present, then the numeric entity is for an
# integer; otherwise, the numeric entity is for a floating-point value.
#
# Grouping follows the usual Shastina convention and is always optional.
#
# Arrays cause an integer to be pushed onto the stack at the end of the
# array indicating how many elements were in the array.  Arrays may be
# nested.

# To begin a specific pedal map, first the map must be opened with the
# "begin_map" operation.  This takes an integer that is one or greater.
# This operation may NOT be nested.
